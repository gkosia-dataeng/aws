Its a deployment option of EMR to run open source software big data framework on EKS
Build, configure and manage the containers of OSS apps
Leverage existing infru of EKS and having a centralize place to manage compute resources


Runtime:

    On eks can have multiple namespaces
    Each namespace can use different runtime


Architecture:

    EKS cluster:
        Virtual EMD clusters: (namespaces in eks) 
                job execution role (iam)
                service link role: the role that the EMR use to speak with EKS (rbac)


    Team submit the job to EMR using EMR API
    The EMR will talk to EKS to spinup the job
    EKS will launch the Job Submitter
    Job Submitter will start the Spark Driver 
    Spark Driver will create Spark Executors
    Spark Driver and Spark Executors will run using the Execution role



Benefits:

    Cost optimization: simplify infru, workload managment consolidation (leverage single eks cluster)
                       utilize ec2 spot instances, saving plans
                       reduce cost with dynamic pod autoscaling (change cpu, memory resource config based on job needs)
                       pay per use (cpu, memory)

    Centralize and unified data governance: new OSS versions within 30 days with 100% OSS compatibility

    Performance: HA and Failover, fast cluster startup and scaling (using k8 ) 

    Productivity: running interactive workloads using EMR studio
                  native integration with AWS Step functions, MWAA, Redshift, Glue Catalog..
                  Monitor from cloudwatch, Prometheus/Grafana

    
    Admin: 
            same infru for all apps (apps consolidation)
            faaster cluster pod, scaling (k8 native)
            Multi AZ resilient




Submit job options:
    cli, MWAA, emr studio, step functions





https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html:

    common pool of resources without having to provision infrastructure
    use EMR studio, aws sdk, aws cli to develop, submit, monitor apps on eks



    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks-concepts.html

    A virtual cluster is a Kubernetes namespace that Amazon EMR is registered with
    Amazon EMR uses virtual clusters to run jobs and host endpoints
    Each virtual cluster maps to one namespace on an EKS cluster
